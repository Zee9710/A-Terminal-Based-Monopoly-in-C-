# A-Terminal-Based-Monopoly-in-C-
Project for Object Oriented Programming Course
Despite its current limitations, such as the absence of features like mortgages, building houses, and auctions, the Monopoly game I developed maintains all other aspects of the object-oriented paradigm. The game utilizes maps in C++, virtual functions, and incorporates a drawboard function for displaying the Monopoly board on the console terminal. By employing maps, I efficiently manage key-value pairs for various game elements. Virtual functions allow for runtime polymorphism, enabling each tile to have a separate function when a player lands upon it. Additionally, the drawboard function brings the game to life visually, providing players with a clear representation of the Monopoly board directly on the console terminal.

Through this project, I focused on implementing fundamental principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, ensuring that the core structure of the game aligns with these principles. While there's room for improvement, this project serves as a solid foundation for further development and enhancement.
